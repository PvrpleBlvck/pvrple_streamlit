### Let's deploy this on streamline

##### Here is how I deployed this tutorial app on Streamlit Share. Once again, Streamlit didnâ€™t fail to surprise me with its convenience.
- Step I: 
> Put your code into a GitHub public repository.
> We need to make sure that it contains a requirement.txt file with all the dependencies.
- Step II: Log into Streamlit using your GitHub account.
- Step III: Create a new app on the Streamlit console.
- Choose your git hub repo from the dropdown or past in the URL. 
- Select the branch that you want to use for the deployment. 
- Finally, pick the main filename and click deploy.
